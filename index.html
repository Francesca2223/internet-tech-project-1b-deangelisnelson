            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Francesca De Angelis Nelson and I am currently a Junior at Loyola University New Orleans majoring in Music Industry Studies. I am interested in possibly becoming an artist manager or something or something else connected to music. I have also studied at John Cabot University in Rome, Italy for a semester and Saint Maryâ€™s College of California also for a semester. I have always been passionate about music. I have played piano for over ten years and I am also a singer/songwriter. I went to a Performing Arts School for middle and high school in Oakland, California. In middle school I was in Instrumental Music where I studied piano for multiple hours a day and then for high school I switched to Vocal Music where I was in multiple choirs and studied vocal performance. I decided to come to Loyola University New Orleans to study the music industry.

            <p>I am a singer/songwriter and I have sung in multiple choirs. Here are a few videos of me singing. The first one is of one of my original songs, "These Eyes, These Hands, This Voice" I performed with my sister at the Fox Theater in Oakland, California for a show with my high school. The second one is a video of my choir singing "Run To You" by the Pentatonix.</p>
